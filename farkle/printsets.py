        5 of any number:              2,000 points
        6 of any number:              3,000 points

        Three pairs:                  1,500 points
        Four of any number + pair:    1,500 points
        Two triplets:                 2,500 points
        Single 1:                     100 points

        Notes:
        - Doubles score nothing (unless a 1 or a 5) as above
        - All scoring dice must be rolled in a single turn (i.e. they
        are not additive over turns)"""
